Thought strategies:
	Pure Bright player would keep investing in races, ending up with a 15pt to cushion, while buffing as needed.

	Pure Dark player would make a cheap race for the game, and keep sacrificing them for eminenece. Use the eminence to curse and destruct foes.

	Pure Progenitor changes the world to favor his races over the others, and uses the mysteries of the land to his advantage.

	Default NPCs are Argaught and Omnisila?
		Argaught is the Seed, creating underground worlds for his amusement that contain artifacts of power. Units can collect these.
		Omnisila is the Ruiner, preparing the world for extinction and the next life to come.
