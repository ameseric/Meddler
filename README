 
Breakdown of directory tree
	Very redundant, but some important points.


Muddled Ones

loader_modules - lua modules that don't act as an O2 object, but upon loading as a module, loads pre-sets for other objects.
					examples are npc_list, which contains a list of npcs stored as parameter value. Upon loading, these parameters
					are used to create a list of npcs.

submodules - 	lua modules that aren't included in the top level (global) namespace. These modules are tacked onto pre-existing global modules.

minor_modules - lua modules that are in the global namespace, but aren't core o2 objects. Rather, they exist separately simply to keep love.main
					clean as possible.



Obvious Ones

docs - project documentation.
images - game images. Mostly .xcf and .png files.
sound - game sounds. One currently.
